# Grow-A-Garden-Macro READ ME

macro updated as of may 25, 2025
[cosmetic and twilight update]

- virages grow a garden macro, revamped by real
- https://www.youtube.com/@VirageRoblox
- https://discord.gg/WgqDA7TWQ9 - virages macro server if you need help

[DISCLAIMER] - GREATLY IMPACT BY LAG SPIKES, IF YOU GET FREQUENT LAG SPIKES THE EGGS MAY FAIL SOMETIMES (the macro shouldn't fully break though) SCROLL DOWN FOR MORE INFO

INSTRUCTIONS:

- to download the file go to releases and download the one called Virage-Grow-A-Garden-Macro-Lunar-RevampedByReal

- you should probably always have auto-align selected, i only added that because it was annoying to sit through the alignment every test

Before starting the macro:
- put your recall wrenches in slot 2
- make sure you have at least 5 items in your hotbar (there is a reason for this but its stupid so just do it)
- set your roblox camera mode to the following --> default(classic)
- turn on ui navigation in roblox settings
- make sure you dont have carrot seed or watering can selected in the shops (like dont have them so that you can see their buy button)
- unequip any pets that increase speed

IMPORTANT:

- FAST MODE HAS VERY LITTLE DELAYS AND REQUIRES A STABLE FRAME RATE (NO LAG SPIKES)
- LAG SPIKES CAN GREATLY AFFECT THE RELIABILITY AND CONSISTENCY OF THE MACRO
- THE EGG CYCLE IS GREATLY AFFECTED BY LAG SPIKES AND YOU COULD WALK TOO FAR OR NOT FAR ENOUGH IF YOU GET A LAG SPIKE (the macro should be able to continue still but it will fail to buy an egg probably)
- IF FAST MODE DOESNT WORK FOR YOU (i.e. fails to open shops or something else because its too fast) THEN TURN IT OFF IT WILL BE MUCH SLOWER BUT MORE STABLE
- use fastmode at your own risk, i've tested it and it works perfectly on as low as 30fps but the delays are still very short between inputs
- if you have a lower end device i recommend not turning it on but you can use still use it if you wish
- if your pc time settings are wrong like your restocks are happening on 0:03 for example, then set your time to be automatic because the macro goes on every multiple of 5

To setup webhook and pings:
- search up how to make a webhook and once you get your url just paste it into the texbox in the macro and click save
- if you want to be pinged when certain items are bought, search up how to get your discord user id and paste that into the textbox in the macro and click save, also turn select discord item pings
- press clear saves to wipe your webhook and userid from the code
- make sure webhook link is a discord.com not discordapp.com (just remove the app)

Confirmed working resolutions:
- 2560x1440 on 125% scale
- 2560x1440 on 100% scale
- 1920x1080 on 100% scale
- 1280x720 on 100% scale
- any other resolution should work as well but are still untested so switch to one of these if it refuses to work on yours (that really shouldn't happen)
