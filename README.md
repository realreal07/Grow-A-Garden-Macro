[lunar update]

- virages grow a garden macro, revamped by real
- https://www.youtube.com/@VirageRoblox
- https://discord.gg/WgqDA7TWQ9 - virages macro server if you need help

Update Log:
- added egg detection so now you can select what eggs you want to buy
- revamped user inputs, no more mouse inputs (besides a few), fully uses roblox ui navigation
- revamped ui to use tabs
- starts a cycle whenever your time is a multiple of 5 (0:05, 00:10, etc.) because thats when restocks happen for everyone scroll down for more info
- should work on all resolutions
- added auto alignment which can be toggled in macro settings, automatically aligns your character when you start
- added a fast mode toggle, if you have a good device its recommended to use it scroll down for more info on it
- added select all buttons in ui so you dont have to manually check every box
- added user inputs in the ui for webhook and discord userid if you want discord messages
- added toggle for discord pings in macro settings
- added a few more webhook integrations (they kinda suck)
- added virages donate tab/links

INSTRUCTIONS:

- to download the file go to releases and download the one called Virage-Grow-A-Garden-Macro-Lunar-RevampedByReal

- you should probably always have auto-align selected, i only added that because it was annoying to sit through the alignment every test

Before starting the macro:
- put your recall wrenches in slot 2
- make sure you have at least 3 items in your hotbar (there is a reason for this but its stupid so just do it)
- set your roblox camera mode to the following --> default(classic)
- turn on ui navigation in roblox settings
- make sure you dont have carrot seed or watering can selected in the shops (like dont have them so that you can see their buy button)

To setup webhook and pings:
- search up how to make a webhook and once you get your url just paste it into the texbox in the macro and click save
- if you want to be pinged when certain items are bought, search up how to get your discord user id and paste that into the textbox in the macro and click save, also turn select discord item pings

IMPORTANT:
- FAST MODE HAS VERY LITTLE DELAYS AND REQUIRES A STABLE FRAME RATE (NO LAG SPIKES)
- LAG SPIKES CAN GREATLY AFFECT THE RELIABILITY AND CONSISTENCY OF THE MACRO
- use fastmode at your own risk, i've tested it and it works perfectly on as low as 30fps but the delays are still very short between inputs
- if you have a lower end device i recommend not turning it on but you can use still use it if you wish
- if your pc time settings are wrong like your restocks are happening on 0:03 for example, then set your time to be automatic because the macro goes on every multiple of 5

Confirmed working resolutions:
- 2560x1440 on 125% scale
- 2560x1440 on 100% scale
- 1920x1080 on 100% scale
- 1280x720 on 100% scale
- any other resolution should work as well but are still untested so switch to one of these if it refuses to work on yours (that really shouldn't happen)
